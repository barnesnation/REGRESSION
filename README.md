**Movie Recommendation Project 2024**

In todayâ€™s technology-driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.
...ever wondered how Netflix, Amazon Prime, Showmax, Disney and the likes somehow know what to recommend to you?

...it's not just a guess drawn out of the hat. There is an algorithm behind it.
What value is achieved through building a functional recommender system?
Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being exposed to content they would like to view or purchase - generating revenue and platform affinity.

**Evaluation**

The evaluation metric for this project is Root Mean Square Error. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is commonly used in regression analysis and forecasting, and measures the standard deviation of the residuals arising between predicted and actual observed values for a modelling process. For our task of generating user movie ratings via recommendation algorithms, the formula is given by:

Where  R^
  is the total number of recommendations generated for users and movies, with  rui
  and  r^ui
  being the true and predicted ratings for user  u
  watching movie  i
  respectively.
